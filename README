For security reasons the API key is not added to the code.

To provide the code with an API key:
    1. Create a new class called ApiKeyProvider
    2. Add the static method getApiKey to the class and return the API key as a string

Example:
package com.cr.androidnanodegree.popularmovies;

public class ApiKeyProvider {
    public static String getApiKey() {
        return "";
    }
}
